The Cooking App aims to simplify meal preparation and enhance the cooking experience by allowing users to efficiently manage their pantry items and discover recipes tailored to their available ingredients. By focusing on user needs, the app promotes creativity in the kitchen while minimizing food waste.

Here are the user stories that guided the development of the app:

User Story 1: As a user, I want to input and manage the items in my pantry easily, ensuring I keep track of what I have on hand.
User Story 2: As a user, I want to receive recipe suggestions based on the items I currently have in my pantry, helping me make the most of my ingredients.
User Story 3: As a user, I want to filter recipe suggestions based on my dietary preferences, so I can find meals that suit my lifestyle.
User Story 4: As a user, I want to be able to like recipes so I can easily find them later, making meal planning more convenient.
By addressing these user stories, the Cooking App creates a practical and enjoyable cooking experience for all users.
