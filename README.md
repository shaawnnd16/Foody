Foody App Description
Welcome to Foody! This app is designed to simplify meal preparation by allowing users to manage their pantry items and discover recipes tailored to their available ingredients.

As a user, you can easily input and manage the items in your pantry, ensuring you keep track of what you have on hand. Foody also provides personalized recipe suggestions based on your current pantry inventory, helping you make the most of your ingredients. You can filter these suggestions by your dietary preferences to find meals that suit your lifestyle. Plus, with the ability to like recipes, you can easily save your favorites for quick access later, making meal planning more convenient.

If the API key doesnâ€™t work, please reach out so I can change it and update the repository on GitHub for you. Thank you!
